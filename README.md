# MatrixAI-Core

## Project Overview

MatrixAI-Core is the foundational repository for the MatrixAI decentralized trust verification system, designed specifically for the Pi Network. This project leverages advanced artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and user-centric environment for verifying identities and transactions.

### Key Features

- **AI-Driven Risk Assessment**: Real-time monitoring and analysis of user behavior to detect anomalies and mitigate risks.
- **Decentralized Identity Verification**: Secure and private identity verification using cryptographic proofs.
- **Dynamic Reputation Scoring**: A reputation system that evolves based on user interactions, promoting trust and accountability.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Integration with smart contracts for efficient and secure transaction processing.
- **Community-Driven Governance**: Empowering users to propose and vote on system updates.
